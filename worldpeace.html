         &nbsp;
         &nbsp;
         <p> 
                Grandi started his career in the office of the United Nations 
                High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR)
                in 1988, and has served in a variety of countries, including 
                Sudan, Syria, Turkey, and
                Iraq after the Gulf War. He also headed a number of emergency 
                operations including in Kenya, Benin, Ghana, Liberia, the Great
                Lakes Region of Central Africa, Yemen and Afghanistan. 
                Between 1996 and 1997, he was Field Coordinator for UNHCR 
                and United Nations humanitarian activities in the Democratic 
                Republic of Congo during the civil war. From 1997 to 2001, 
                he worked in the Executive Office of the UNHCR in Geneva, 
                as Special Assistant and then Chief of Staff. From 2001 to 
                2004, he served as the UNHCR's Chief of Mission.
                Grandi then moved to the United Nations Assistance Mission in 
                Afghanistan (UNAMA) in 2004, where he served as Deputy Special 
                Representative of the Secretary-General responsible for 
                political affairs from 2004 to 2005. In 2005 he moved to UNRWA, 
                first as Deputy Commissioner-General and then from 2010 as 
                Commissioner-General until 29 March 2014. 
                On 11 November 2015 UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon announced 
                his intention to appoint Grandi as the next United Nations 
                High Commissioner for Refugees to take office in 2016.[4] On 23 
                November 2020, the United Nations General Assembly re-elected 
                Grandi for an additional 2.5 year mandate as High Commissioner 
                for Refugees Since 2019.
                Grandi has been a member of the World Economic Forum High-Level 
                Group on Humanitarian Investing, co-chaired by BÃ¸rge Brende, 
                Kristalina Georgieva and Peter Maurer.
                During the 2024 Summer Olympics opening ceremony, Grandi was 
                presented with an Olympic Laurel, the third person to be honored, 
                for his work in helping refugee athletes.
                In July 2025, the Spanish government awarded him the Grand Cross 
                of the Order of Isabella the Catholic
